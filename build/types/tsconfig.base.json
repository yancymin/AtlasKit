  // It might seem like a good idea to have `"include": ["../../packages/**/*"]` here, but there's
  // a subtle problem with that approach, which is that ts-loader will incur a performance hit by trying
  // to include *every* package's files when compiling a file (rather than just the files that it needs).
  //
  // Instead, each package that is written in TypeScript needs to have its own `tsconfig.json` in its root
  // that extends this file, but has an `"include": ["**/*"]` override.
